# OSF Digital Internship Training
This repository contains all the code that I developed during the training program. It includes the 'Notes' folder with all the annotations that I made while studying, the 'Trailhead' folder with all the code that I developed to complete the trailhead challenges, and the 'Practical Exercises' folder with the codes of the practical exercises provided by OSF Digital.

# Usage
You can use this code as a reference for your own projects or to learn from it. The 'Notes' folder contains detailed annotations on the topics covered during the training program, which can be helpful for reviewing the concepts. The 'Trailhead' folder has the code developed to complete the trailhead challenges, which can serve as examples of how to implement specific functionalities. The 'Practical Exercises' folder has the codes of the practical exercises that I worked on, which can help to understand how to apply the concepts in a real-world scenario.
